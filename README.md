Many Security operation centers, AKA SOCS, are starting to implement some kind of SOAR, "Security", "Orchestration", "Automation", and "Response Solution", if they haven't done so already. There are many different SOAR vendors out there and it doesn't really matter which one they implement since the concepts and objective remain the same. "Reduce repetitive tasks with automation while following a structured process", these processes are also known as, Playbooks.
  
  When it comes to SOAR, without an experienced individual developing playbooks and continuously improving them, SOAR just becomes another expensive tool that was sold to an organization as "the end and be all". With Blockchain, NextGen, state-of-the-art military-grade AI... 
  
  But seriously, because many SOCs are going to be using some kind of SOAR implementation, I thought it would be a great idea to provide you with another automation project. And if you haven't seen my previous project called, the SOC Automation Project, I would recommend you go and check that out. In that project, we used Shuffle as the sword. In this project, I'll be using, Tines, as the SOAR platform. And you might be thinking... Can't you just use Shuffle? And you're right, I could, but I wanted to stress the importance that a tool, is just a tool. It doesn't matter which vendor you use because the concept is the same. In addition to Tines, I'll be using LimaCharlie, acting as my EDR endpoint detection and response. I'll also have one Windows Virtual Machine, AKA VM, in the cloud as the agent. You don't need to spin up a VM in the cloud, if you don't want to. You could use any Windows machine, as long as it has internet connectivity. You might have a burning question, "Well Bryan, What if I don't know how to code? And that is perfectly fine. We'll be using Chatgbt to help us, if needed. Aswell as documentation from both Tines and LimaCharlie, that will be extremely helpful. What you'll need to be successful in this project is curiosity and patience. And when building playbooks, you'll need logic and a place to diagram your workflow. 
  
  In this project, we will be working together to build a detection in LimaCharlie that will detect the tool used to recover passwords on a machine. Then, we'll send that over to Tines, which will have a playbook that we'll create. (Just FYI, Tines will call playbooks as "stories", so do be aware of the terminology) but anyways the story will then send us an email send a slack message and finally ask the user if they want to isolate the machine and if the user says yes lima charlie will then isolate the machine automatically after going through this five-part series you will not only gain hands-on experience working with an EDR such as lima charlie but also sore experience using ties which I positive will help you in your professional career now this is going to be very Hands-On and can be difficult depending on your level of experience so do plan to carve out some time if you want to participate by the end of theproject you will have a custom detection rule built in Li ma Charlie and a Playbook that integrates slack and emails along with a responsive capability thanks to Lima Charlie beginning with part one we will begin designing our Playbook workflow and then drawing out how we want that to work do keep in mind that changes can and will likely happen as it is perfectly normal during the Playbook creation phase to find out that certain functionality just doesn't exist or the logic just doesn't make sense in other words you don't need to know exactly what your playbook workflow will look like but it is a good idea to diagram the things that you want to do as this will help you organize your thoughts in part two I will walk you through on how to set up lima charlie and we start to get our data in from our Windows machine if you want to get a head start I'll provide a video down below that I created about lima charlie and then you can begin getting data in otherwise you can wait for this part of the project for part three you'll generate events on your Windows machine using the password recovery tool and I'll walk you through on how you can create your own custom detection and response rule in Lima Charlie this rule is then going to be sent over to ties to begin our Automation in part four you'll get set up with slack which is a messaging platform and ties the objective for this part is to begin integrating lima charlie with ties essentially creating that link between the two applications and then we'll validate to make sure that we are getting the detections inside of timeses finally the last part of the project will be all about automation this is where we begin creating our Playbook SL story in times and will likely be a longer video My Hope Is that once you go through this project not only will you learn something new but also gain more confidence in your technical skills one thing I do want you to keep in mind is that if you do encounter errors please try and research them and see what you can find go through documentation utilize chat gbt and and if you still cannot find the answer leave it in the comment section down below as someone might have had the same error and found the fix lastly I just released the my dfir sock analyst course which contains over 30 plus Hands-On labs and five exclusive sock projects if you or someone you know is interested in particularly the security operations domain this course is designed to help students learn how to ask better questions and investigate Network endpoint malare identity and Cloud related Telemetry once you purchase it it is yours for life and these updates are free the price is going to be $4.99 plus tax USD and I'll put everything in the description down below I hope that you're as excited as I am to get started on this project if you do plan on following along please think about putting it onto your portfolio using any free site or GitHub I really want you to Showcase your work and be proud of something that you built that is it for the video and thank you for watching remember to stay curious and do things differently
